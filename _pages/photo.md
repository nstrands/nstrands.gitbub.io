title: Photography
subtitle: Photography became a hobby of mine after a trip to Svalbard in 2009, where I was disappointed with how my photos turned out. Since then, I’ve developed a passion for landscape and nature photography, and I’ve been shooting with Sony mirrorless cameras since 2016. This portfolio showcases some of my favorite shots from over the years.
