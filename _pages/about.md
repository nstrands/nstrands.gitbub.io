My journey into web development started back in 2008 while working at the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, where I maintained a WordPress blog to document my work. This continued throughout my studies until 2012, when I made a big career shift, transitioning from oceanography research to web development. Around that time, a position opened up in the lab I was assisting, and I began managing and updating their Joomla! site. Over the following months, my role expanded, and I eventually took on the maintenance of over 20 websites for the Rutgers University Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, working across Joomla!, WordPress, Drupal, and custom HTML/CSS/JS sites.

In December 2016, I joined Achieve3000 as a lead web developer for the marketing department, focusing on designing, building, and optimizing marketing emails and landing pages on the Salesforce Pardot platform. My responsibilities included contributing to the design process, coding the designs using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and QA testing across devices and platforms with Litmus. I also managed updates for corporate websites, microsites, and landing pages.

After a brief contract role as an email developer at Travelers Insurance, I joined New Avon LLC in the fall of 2018, gaining experience with B2C marketing platforms like Cheetah and Salesforce Marketing Cloud. There, I worked with advanced dynamic content and segmentation filters, helping personalize email communications for over 2 million subscribers based on their shopping trends.

In March 2020, I started working at Wiley as a Marketing Automation Developer, where I build dynamic email campaigns, complex segmentation, and landing pages in support of the company’s research branch. This role has allowed me to continue refining my development skills while supporting a global team.

## Science
In 2008, I began working at the Coastal Ocean Observation Lab (RUCOOL), assisting with a variety of projects ranging from ocean-atmosphere interactions in the North Atlantic to polar ocean dynamics. I was also part of the first team to pilot a robotic glider across an ocean basin. My work took me on trips to Svalbard, Norway, San Luis Obispo, CA, Spain, Washington D.C., and the UK as part of various research and outreach efforts, including the NORUS Program and the Challenger Glider Mission.

Since graduating with a degree in Biological Oceanography from Rutgers University in 2012, I’ve continued working with RUCOOL as a pilot for the Challenger Glider Mission, a project that aims to circumnavigate the world's oceans with a fleet of 16 autonomous underwater vehicles. The mission supports climate research and public education, and I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate internationally, including time spent in the Canary Islands and the UK promoting the project.

Since 2022, I’ve leveraged Wiley’s tuition reimbursement program to return to school, pursuing a Master’s in Conservation Biology at the University of West Alabama and a Graduate Certificate in Geospatial Analysis from the University of Florida. This combination of studies allows me to merge my interests in conservation and technology, focusing on remote sensing and data analysis to protect marine habitats facing the challenges of climate change.
